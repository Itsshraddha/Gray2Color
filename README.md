## 🪶 About the Project

**Gray2Color** is a visually expressive image transformation project that reimagines how grayscale signals are perceived.  
Using the power of **digital signal processing and color mapping**, it breathes life into black-and-white images — reviving emotion, tone, and visual depth.

This project bridges the mathematical world of *signals and systems* with the artistry of *color perception*, creating a beautiful blend of science and creativity. 🌸

## 🧭 Vision & Concept

> “Grayscale is truth — color is interpretation.”

In this project, each grayscale pixel intensity is treated as a **signal**, and through color transformation techniques, those signals are reinterpreted into **dynamic visual frequencies**.  

By mapping pixel values to color gradients, the project showcases **signal transformation** as a real-world visualization concept — a core principle of your *Signals & Systems* subject.
